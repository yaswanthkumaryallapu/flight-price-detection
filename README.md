# Flight Price Detection

## Overview
The Flight Price Detection project predicts the price of flights based on various factors such as date, time, source, destination, airline, and other variables. This model can be useful for users looking to book flights at the best price by analyzing trends and patterns in airfare data.

## Features
- **Predicts Flight Prices**: Provides estimated flight prices based on input parameters.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes flight data to understand price variations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to input flight details and get instant price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Model**: [Specify model used, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.]
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- **Frontend (if any)**: Streamlit / Flask (for web interface)

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset that contains information on flight details, such as:
- **Date of Journey**
- **Airline**
- **Source** and **Destination**
- **Route**
- **Duration**
- **Total Stops**
- **Price**

> **Note**: Ensure you have permission to use any dataset you include. Mention the source if it's publicly available data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flight-price-detection
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application (for Streamlit):
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Input Details**: Enter flight information like date, source, destination, and stops.
2. **Predict Price**: Click the predict button to get an estimated price for the flight.
3. **View Results**: See the predicted price and other analysis results.

## Model Training
- The model was trained using [specify training process here].
- Achieved an accuracy of [mention accuracy if available].

## Future Improvements
- Add more parameters like class of travel.
- Implement time-series analysis for price trends.
- Integrate with live flight data APIs.
